# CLIMoneyTracker
Command line app for keeping track of expenses

I used this app on windows and ubuntu.

My preferred way to use this program was with an alias in my bashrc to change directories and run "python main.py"

I don't use this anymore as I switched to an online financial tool so I don't have to manually keep track of everything. When I did want to manually keep track of everything, this program was wonderful to work with. I used it for a couple years.

## Features

CLIMoneyTracker has an intuitive menu interface to enter transactions, search for transactions, and display graphs. Any entry can also be searched for and deleted or reentered. I really enjoyed the graphs to visualize my cash flow just how I wanted to.

Everything is stored in files, so there is no need to worry about databases. Paths are all relative, so it must be run from the same directory everytime (an area of improvement). If I was to do this over, I would probably use "rich" for prettier output.

The balance can be corrected if something is off or you don't feel like entering all your transactions.

The current year must be set from the settings menu.

Multiple users can be added. To delete users, delete the username folder and their corresponding settings.txt entries
