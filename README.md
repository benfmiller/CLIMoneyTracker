# CLIMoneyTracker
Command line app for keeping track of expenses

I used this app on windows and ubuntu, and it can be used on any platform.

For my purposes, setting up an alias in my bashrc to change to switch directories and run "python main.py" was a great way to use this program.

## Features

CLIMoneyTracker has an intuitive menu interface to enter transactions, search for transactions, and display graphs. 

Multiple users can be added and the balance of the current user can be manually adjusted at any time. Any entry can be searched for and deleted. 

The current year must be set from the settings menu.

To delete users, delete the username folder and their corresponding settings.txt entries
